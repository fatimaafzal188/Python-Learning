#logical operators
#they are either true/false , yes/no or 0/1
# below are some basic logical operators
# equal to                 ==   (comparison of two things like 2==2)
# not equal to             !=
# less then                <
# less then or equal to       <=
# greater then              >
# greater then or equal to      >=

#EXAMPLE
# print(4==4)      #it give us 'true' in the terminel
# print(4==5)      #it gives us 'false' in the terminal
# print(3>6)
# print(3<=6)
  
#application of logical operators
# Ali_age=4
# minimun_age_at_school=5
# print(Ali_age==minimun_age_at_school)


#using input function with logical operators
Ali_age=input('how old is ali')    #input function
minimun_age_at_school=5 
print(Ali_age==minimun_age_at_school)   #logical operator
Ali_age=int(Ali_age)
print(type(Ali_age))
